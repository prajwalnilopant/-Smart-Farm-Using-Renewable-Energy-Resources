# Smart Farm Using Renewable Energy Resources

## Overview
This project aims to create a smart farming system that utilizes various renewable energy resources and environmental sensors to monitor and optimize farm conditions. The system collects data such as temperature, humidity, UV intensity, hydrogen levels, and water level, which are crucial for maintaining optimal growing conditions for crops.

## Components Used
- **Arduino Uno**: Microcontroller used as the brain of the system.
- **DHT11 Sensor**: Measures temperature and humidity.
- **MQ2 Sensor**: Detects hydrogen levels.
- **ML8511 UV Sensor**: Measures UV intensity.
- **Water Level Sensor**: Monitors water levels in tanks or reservoirs.
- **Ethernet Shield**: Enables communication with ThingSpeak IoT platform.
- **ThingSpeak**: IoT platform for storing and analyzing sensor data.

## Setup
### Hardware Setup
1. Connect sensors to Arduino Uno as per the pin configuration in the code:
   - DHT11 Sensor to pin 8
   - MQ2 Sensor to A3
   - ML8511 UV Sensor UVOUT to A0, REF_3V3 to A1
   - Water Level Sensor to A4
2. Ensure Ethernet Shield is properly connected to enable communication with the internet.

### Software Setup
1. Upload the provided Arduino sketch (`SmartFarm.ino`) to your Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
2. Configure your ThingSpeak account with the provided `myChannelNumber` and `myWriteAPIKey` in the sketch.
3. Adjust any pin configurations or sensor calibrations as necessary for your setup.

## Operation
Once the Arduino is powered on and connected to the internet via Ethernet, it will continuously read sensor data at regular intervals (adjustable in the sketch). This data is then sent to ThingSpeak for storage and visualization.

## Monitoring and Analysis
- Use ThingSpeak to monitor real-time and historical sensor data.
- Analyze trends in temperature, humidity, UV intensity, hydrogen levels, and water levels to make informed decisions about farm operations.
- Set up alerts or notifications based on sensor thresholds to respond promptly to changes in environmental conditions.

## Future Enhancements
- **Battery Power**: Implement solar or battery power for off-grid operation.
- **Remote Control**: Integrate actuators to control irrigation systems based on sensor data.
- **Data Analytics**: Use machine learning algorithms to predict crop health or optimize resource usage.
